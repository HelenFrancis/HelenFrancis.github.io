I use manual and automated patch-clamp electrophysiology to disentangle the activation modes of human TRP channels. I am specifically interested in TRPV1, a pain and heat receptor. TRPV1 has been an attractive drug target to phase out the use of opioids. However, most drugs that have been designed to target TRPV1 for pain relief have been unsuccessful. My research provides fundamental information on how the human TRPV1 receptor functions in human cells, this information can be used to improve TRPV1 targeting drugs.

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
