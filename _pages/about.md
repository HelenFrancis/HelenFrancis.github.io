I use manual and automated patch-clamp electrophysiology to disentangle the activation modes of human TRP channels. I am specifically interested in TRPV1, a pain and heat receptor. TRPV1 has been an attractive drug target to phase out the use of opioids. However, most drugs that have been designed to target TRPV1 for pain relief have been unsuccessful. My research provides fundamental information on how the human TRPV1 receptor functions in human cells, this information can be used to improve TRPV1 targeting drugs.
